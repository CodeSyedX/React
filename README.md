# React Documentation

Welcome to the React Documentation repository! This repository contains resources and documentation for building applications using **React.js**.




## 📝 Introduction

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It is widely used for creating single-page applications (SPAs) and mobile apps with a component-based architecture. React allows developers to build reusable UI components that can be easily combined to create complex UIs.

This repository contains documentation and guides for getting started with React, learning about its core concepts, and exploring advanced features.
